# A*-simulation
# ðŸ§­ A* Pathfinding Algorithm with Waypoints (Pygame)

This project visualizes the **A\*** (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm using Python and **Pygame**, with support for **mandatory waypoints**. It demonstrates how A* can navigate from a start to an end point, visiting intermediate waypoints in the shortest order.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Visual grid environment built with Pygame
- Set **Start**, **End**, **Barriers**, and **Waypoints**
- Visualize the **shortest path** through all waypoints
- Supports **multiple permutations** to find the optimal path order
- Interactive mouse-based placement
